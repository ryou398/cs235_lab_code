        <li>First step was to look for everything that I neeed to download and setup on my laptop. </li> 
        <li> I have chosen to use Visual Studio Code. </li> 
        <li> Things I downloaded and setup: Visual Studio Code, Miniconda, Python, Git (Have not learned to use yet) </li> 
        <li> Visual Studio Code was a simple download and install. </li> 
        <li> Miniconda was another download and install but it included another step of learning how to utilise it in Visual Studio. </li> 
        <li> Although Git was not required to be installed, I have installed it anyway. </li> 
      </ol>
