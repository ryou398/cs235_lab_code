# Lab Report 3

Ricky Young

## Start of lab

1. I did not do lab 2 of last week so I spent time to learn how to use Git/Github.

2. I forked the cs235_lab_code repo to my own github account and cloned it to my laptop.

3. I played around all three demoes (HTML/CSS/Bootstrap).

## Hands-on Part 1

1. Created a html page using my first lab report as a template

2. Added headings, a paragraph (had to convert my list to a coherent one), a link to my github account, an image of my dog, a table, and the form.

3. I created the img folder under ./static/
