# Lab Report 3

Ricky Young

## Start of lab

1. I did not do lab 2 of last week so I spent time to learn how to use Git/Github.

2. I forked the cs235_lab_code repo to my own github account and cloned it to my laptop.

3. I played around all three demoes (HTML/CSS/Bootstrap).

## Hands-on Part 1

1. Created a html page using my first lab report as a template

2. Added headings, a paragraph (had to convert my list to a coherent one), a link to my github account, an image, a table, and the form.

3. I created the img folder under ./static/ and added a photo of my dog.

4. Used the existing css to play around with different selectors such as: h1, h2, p, form .etc

5. Wrapped the heading, lab information, and the dog selections together respectively. I will adjust the margin and padding through the browser developer tool.

6. I used the browser developer tool to adjust all the elements in my body to be centered.

## Hands-on Part 2

- Mostly used the div tag ids to style the webpage through the css file.

## Questions

1. HTML (or hyper text markup language) is the standard language used in most webpages. HTML tags designate what element/component the body of lanugage will be.

```HTML
<h1>Heading</h1> will "tag" the Heading word with a header.
```

2. There are six levels of headings in html (h1-h6)

3. It should still be in the format as the starting tag. However things like css won't be able to tell if the tags are nested or not.

4.

```HTML
<-- Added comment in between the arrows. -->
```
5. Id, element, and class selector.

6. The padding deals with the spacing between the border of the element and the content while the margin deals with outside of the border.

7. px and pt.
